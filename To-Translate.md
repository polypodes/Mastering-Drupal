Drupal stuff to translate
========================

* [l10n_client](https://drupal.org/project/l10n_client )
  A very useful tool for the translation of the website. Can be used by everyone, just add permission for the role(s) you want.

  It's create a toolbar you can open manually or by "ctrl+s" on the word you want to translate. Save your translation and reload the page. Taaaaaddaaaaaa you word is now translated.
  => really useful for front-page translation, faster than going to 'admin/config/regional/translate/translate'
