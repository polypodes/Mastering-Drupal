Drupal stuff to translate
========================

* [l10n_client](https://drupal.org/project/l10n_client )

  A very useful tool for the translation of the website. Can be used by everyone, just add permission for the role(s) you want.  
  That module creates a toolbar you can open manually or with the shortcut "ctrl+s" on the word you want to translate.   
  Save your translation and reload the page.  
  Taaaaaddaaaaaa your word is now translated.  
  => really useful for front-page translation, faster than going to 'admin/config/regional/translate/translate'
